PAL Ontology pal (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

This ontology imports ontologies 1-7 (time, logic, upper, dial,
dom, sem, dmgoals) through OWL import statements.
Interlinking the four ontologies is achieved through OWL axiom
constructors, by incorporating domain/range restrictions, typing
constraints, cardinality restrictions, and by directly relating
classes, properties, and instances.  For instance ("<=" denotes
rdfs:subClassOf, "=" owl:equivalentClass, ":" rdf:type):

  ;; Activity is a subclass of Happening
  dom:Activity <= upp:Happening
  ;; class Actor is equivalent to class Agent
  dom:Actor == upp:Agent
  dom:Actor == sem:Actor
  dom:Actor == dial:Agent
  dom:Color <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Device <= upp:Object
  dom:Disease <= upp:Happening
  dom:EmotionalState <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Food <= upp:Object
  dom:Goal <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Hobby <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Issue <= upp:Happening
  dom:LabValue <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Location == upp:Place
  dom:Location == sem:Location
  dom:Mood <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Output <= upp:Abstract
  dom:PhysicalState <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Sentiment <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Symptoms <= upp:Abstract
  dom:Treatment <= uppHappening
  ;; the range of property dial:frame is class sem:Frame
  T <= dial:frame . sem:Frame
  ;; the two properties are equivalent
  dom:name == upp:name
  
Individuals that occur in a dialogue should usually be defined here,
using namespace pal.
