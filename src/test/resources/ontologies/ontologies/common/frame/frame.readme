FrameNet Frame Ontology frame (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

The most sophisticated ontology integrates ideas from the DIT++ taxonomy
of dialogue acts (see http://dit.uvt.nl) and from the FrameNet lexical
database (see http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/).
Frames and dialogue acts are modelled independently from one another,
but dialogue acts incorporates frames through the property dafn:frame.
Dialogue acts also encode the succession of dialogue acts through
dafn:follows, define the dafn:sender, and the dafn:addressee, but also
allow a kind of embedding to model indirect speech in questions and
answers via property dafn:refersTo.
Modeling the shallow semantic arguments inside the frames frees us from
defining repeating properties on various dialogue acts over and over
again.

note: version v0.9.3 (21 Jan 2016) now separates the DIT taxonomy from
the definitions of the frames in two distinct ontologies.
