Upper Ontology upper (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

The upper ontology is a minimal and stripped-down upper ontology that
we have originally developed for the EU projects Musing, Monnet, and
TrendMiner, showing a tri-partite structure with the top-most classes
upp:Abstract, upp:Happening, and upp:Physical.
Most notable for PAL is the Happening representation which distinguishes
between atomic upp:Situations and decomposable upp:Events, using
properties such as upp:startsWith, upp:continuesWith, and upp:endsWith.
This allows us to encode PDL-like processes and makes it also possible
to define pre- and post-conditions.
