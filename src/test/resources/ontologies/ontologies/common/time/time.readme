Temporal Ontology time (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

The temporal ontology encodes the binary distinction between
synchronic and diachronic properties through the (meta-)classes
time:SynchronicProperty and time:DiachronicPropertry, subclasses
of the class rdf:Property.
This allows us to cross-classify properties as being open to a
temporal change or staying constant.
The time ontology also defines the property time:assigns in order
to encode the continuation of a variable-like instances over time.

Version 0.9.2 introduces the class time:Undefined (for OWL-like
punning) and a singleton instance time:undefined_sinngleton that
should be used, in case punning is not wanted (no need to work
with several individuals).
